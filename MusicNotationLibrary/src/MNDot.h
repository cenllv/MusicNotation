/*! The `MNDot` class implements dot modifiers for notes.

 In Western musical notation, a dotted note is a note with a small dot written after it.
 In modern practice the first dot increases the duration of the basic note by half of its
 original value. A dotted note is equivalent to writing the basic note tied to a note of
 half the value; or with more than one dots, tied to notes of progressively halved value.[1]
 The length of any given note a with n dots is therefore given by the geometric series
 a_n=a\left(1+\tfrac 12+\tfrac 14+ \cdots + \tfrac 1{2^n}\right)=a(2-\frac 1{2^n}).
 More than three dots are highly uncommon but theoretically possible;[2] only quadruple
 dots have been attested.[3]

 A rhythm using longer notes alternating with shorter notes (whether notated with dots or not)
 is sometimes called a dotted rhythm. Historical examples of music performance styles using
 dotted rhythm include notes in√©gales and swing. The precise performance of dotted rhythms
 can be a complex issue. Even in notation that includes dots, their performed values may be
 longer than the dot mathematically indicates, a practice known as over-dotting.[4]
